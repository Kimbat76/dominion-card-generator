### NEW FEATURES IN THIS FORK

This fork of the original project has been made in order to allow the production of specific cards that where not supported in the original project.
New features :
- Gradient color (color to greyish background) for 2 colors cards, such as "Contract". (Option "Double Gradient" in Split Posision). This feature encompass as well color to regular Action/Event, i.e. one sided gradient.
- Not only numerical values on top of icons (coins, debt ...) but as well alphabetical, to allow "x2" in coins symbol for the "Fortune" card.


### Disclaimer
